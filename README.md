# CrackTheCode
CrackTheCode is a collection of commonly used problems for testing one's coding aptitude and problem solving skills. Here focus will be on solution and optimization.

### Algorithm Discussion

Alogrithm is a step by step solution to a given problem. example could be a step by step recipe of preparing your favourite dish

As ways for prearing a dish could be different and thus there could be mutiple ways/algorithm of solving a problem. Take for an instance, sorting problem, sorting can be done by insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and many more.

How do we compare algorithms then, which one is better? 

Execution time: It could be different one for different computers, depending on processor speeds & thus it's not relevant.

Number of statements executed?: That's also not a good measure as choice of programming language may decide number of steps and how processor creates instruction sets.

So, in that case, ideal solution could be running time of a given alogrithm as a function of input size and compare these running times functions. These functions would be independent of machine type, programming styles etc.

Rate of growth: The rate @ which running time increases as function of input.

| Time Complexity  | Name  | Description |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
|     1         | Constant        | whatever is input size n, these functions take constant amount of time |
|   log n       | Logarithmic     | These are slower growing than linear function |
|     n         | Linear          | These functions grow linearly with input size n |
|   n log n     | Linear Logarithmic          | Faster than linear |
|     n2         | Quadratic          | Grow faster than linear |
